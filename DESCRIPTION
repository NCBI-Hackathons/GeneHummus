Description: A pipeline with high specificity and sensitivity in extracting 
  proteins from the RefSeq database (National Center for Biotechnology 
  Information). Manual identification of gene families is highly 
  time-consuming and laborious, requiring an iterative process of manual and 
  computational analysis to identify members of a given family. The pipelines 
  implements an automatic approach for the identification of gene families 
  based on the conserved domains that specifically define that family. See 
  Die et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/436659> for more information and examples.
