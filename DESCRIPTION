Description: A pipeline with high specificity and sensitivity in extracting
  proteins from the RefSeq database (National Center for Biotechnology 
  Information). Manual identification of gene families is highly 
  time-consuming and laborious, requiring an iterative process of manual 
  and computational analysis to identify members of a given family. The 
  pipelines implements an automatic approach for the identification of gene
  families based on the conserved domains that specifically define that 
  family. See Die et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/436659> for more information 
  and examples.
