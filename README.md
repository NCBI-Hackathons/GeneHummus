# GeneHummus

An Automated Pipeline to Classify Gene Families based on Protein Domain Organization using Auxin Response Factors in **chickpea** and other Legumes as an Example

## Workflow

## Phylogeny  

![](PhyloIO_Tree.svg)

* How many sister pairs are between two different species?   
* How many sister pairs are between the same species?   
* Proteins belonging the same group within a species, do they locate on the same chromosome?  
* What does this information tell us about the expansion of the ARF in Legumes? -in terms of gene duplications (early/ancestral)-  

* Ancestral Proteins were Present in the Last common ancestor before the species diverged from each other.   
* Single Exception: A XXX subclass with no homology to any other legume.
